        <div class="mb-5">
            <p>I'm hungry...</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Join a dining slot before it's closing time (often 15:30).</li>
                <li>Be on time and join the meal. Dinners take place in the kitchen and living room.</li>
                <li>The cook will determine the price of the meal and share the costs. A payment link can be set on the dining list</li>
                <li>â‚¬0,50 is automatically subtracted from your account. If your balance is negative, please contact your association board. Pay money to your association and they will upgrade the money on your account.</li>
                <li>Be a nice person and help with the dishes. Please keep the kitchen clean for everyone ðŸ™‚</li>
            </ol>
            <p>I want to cook!</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Reserve a spot in the kitchen by claiming a dining slot. If you claim the last slot, choose your dinnertime 30 minutes before or after one of the other groups.</li>
                <li>Fill in the requested information (meal, starttime, association). At least 12 people should be able to join.</li>
                <li>Buy the groceries and cook! The kitchen can be used from 16:30h to 19:30h. Every board member can access the key of the kitchen.</li>
                <li>Enjoy your meal. Donâ€™t forget to provide food for the latecomers.</li>
                <li>Recruit volunteers for the dishes and mark who did what (shop, cook, clean) in the app. This way we can ensure that everyone helps in the kitchen</li>
            </ol>
            Enjoy your meal!

        <h2>Frequently asked questions</h2>
        <p>
            <i>Can I claim a slot for all associations?</i><br>
            No, you can only claim a slot for the associations you are a member of (as long as that association doesnâ€™t already have a slot claimed).
        </p>
        <p>
            <i>How can I upgrade my balance?</i><br>
            This varies per association, for more information visit the <a href="{% url 'upgrade_instructions' %}">upgrade balance Page</a>
        </p>
        <p>
            <i>Are the costs of the meal also taken from my in-app balance?</i><br>
            No. Not at this point. There are still some technical and bureaucratic hurdles that need to be taken. Maybe one day, but not for now.
        </p>
        <p>
            <i>Can I reserve the kitchen for only my association?</i><br>
            This is possible in special cases, send an e-mail to secretaris@studentencultuur.nl.
